                <p>How to get started
                </p>
                <p>Start with manageable goals, whether it’s walking 30 minutes a day or doing strength training twice a week.
                    Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your workouts as your fitness level improves.</p>
                    <p>Exercise shouldn’t feel like a chore! Find activities you love, whether it’s dancing, hiking, or cycling. When you enjoy the exercise, you’re more likely to stick with it.

                <p>Why is excercise important?
                </p>
                <p>Exercise is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. It benefits both the body and mind, helping prevent disease, improve mood, and boost energy levels. Here's a breakdown of why exercise is so important</p>
                <p>Strengthens the Heart and Lungs: Exercise improves cardiovascular health by enhancing heart function, improving blood circulation, and increasing lung capacity. This reduces the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke.
                    Maintains Healthy Weight: Regular exercise helps burn calories, reduce body fat, and maintain a healthy weight, lowering the risk of obesity, diabetes, and related conditions.
                    Boosts Immunity: Physical activity strengthens the immune system, making it more effective in fighting off infections and illnesses.
                    Enhances Muscle and Bone Health: Exercise, especially strength training, builds muscle mass, strengthens bones, and increases bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.</p>
