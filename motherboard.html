            <p>Healthy eating is all about balance, variety, and moderation. It involves consuming a wide range of nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and energy to support overall well-being.

            </p>

            <p>Limit Processed Foods & Sugar, reduce consumption of packaged foods high in refined sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Choose natural sweeteners like honey or fruits instead of refined sugar. Read food labels to check for hidden sugars and preservatives.
            </p>

            <p>Eat a balanced diet - Fruits and Vegetables: Aim to fill half your plate with a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
                Protein: Include lean proteins such as chicken, fish, tofu, beans, lentils, or eggs. Protein is crucial for muscle repair and immune function.
                Whole Grains: Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole-wheat bread over refined grains to get more fiber and nutrients.
                Healthy Fats: Include sources of unsaturated fats like avocados, olive oil, nuts, and seeds. These are beneficial for heart health.
                Dairy or Alternatives: Opt for low-fat dairy products or fortified plant-based alternatives like almond milk or soy milk for calcium and vitamin D.
            </p>

            <p>Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated. Water is essential for digestion, skin health, and energy levels.
                Limit sugary drinks like sodas and fruit juices, as they add empty calories and sugar.
            </p>
